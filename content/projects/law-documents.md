### Online editor

There was a task to build online editor for law documents based on templates and fill in the gaps using user requisites: contact info, personal info, company info.
Other issues were: prepare document for printing, download ready document file with choose format, and share a document by a link with others.

To do that, team chose the `tiptap` editor library with custom buttons for using the complex functions of this rich editor package.
