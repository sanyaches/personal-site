# Open my first company in Georgia

Dear reader, have a nice day!

Today I'm going to the great country - Georgia with some interesting purpose. I want to open an individual company in Georgia. I do it because I'd like to be open to the rest of the world, providing them with software development services.

Such a good though, isn't it? I can do what I'm passionate about - build softwares, and the opportunity to work with me and get my services will be available for everyone in the world. Awesome!

The icing on top of that is the opportunity to decide - Who I will work with and how I will pay taxes. Georgia is famous for its low taxes - about 1-3% depends on your amount.

Also, I will get an access to receive payments online and worldwide if I open my online business and sell something. I have some thoughts about it.


Wish me good luck these couple of days I'll spend by this process.
